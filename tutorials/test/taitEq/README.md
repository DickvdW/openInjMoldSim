# taitEq

The pressure, temperature and specific volume must fulfil the Tait equation of state. The analyze.py script
recalculates the density evolution based on the simulated pressure and temperature evolutions. Comparing this calculation
of density with the OpenFOAM output validates the equation of state implementation.
